# Analysing-the-GDP-of-Indian-States
The data for this project has been sourced from  https://data.gov.in/

The project is divided into 2 part, namely:

Part -I
Comparing the Total and Per Capita GDP of Indian States via sectors and sub-sectors to see the contribution of each sector
in the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product).
This is then used to generate insights for each state as to which sector and within it sub-sector can be improved upon.
These insights will assist in decision making.

Part-II
Correlating the Per Capita GDP with the dropout rates in schools.
The states have been divided into 4 buckets and the relation between the per capita GDP and the dropout rates is analysed.
